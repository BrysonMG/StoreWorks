# StoreWorks
#### StoreWorks is a full-stack inventory mangement application (React + Web API built with C# .NET)
This application was designed for product-based-business owners and managers to keep track of their incoming and outgoing inventory. The are two types of users, employees and managers. Employees are able to submit sold and received products and log in shrinkage (lost, stolen, or damaged) from the available inventory list, which managers are able to do as well. Managers have the added capability to add to, edit, or delete from the inventory list, promote and demote employees to/from manager, and delete other users.

Managers are also able to see a summary of sales, received products, and shrinkage, as well as the net gain or loss and the total value of all on-hand products.
